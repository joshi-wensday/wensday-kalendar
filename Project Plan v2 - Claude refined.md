## Notes for Josh
### API Key protection
To protect API keys and other sensitive information:

- Use environment variables to store sensitive data.
- Create a `.env` file in your project root to store these variables locally.
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to the repository.
- Use `process.env.API_KEY` in your code to access these variables.
- For deployment, set up environment variables in Vercel's dashboard.

### Vercel Cost Limits:

- Go to your Vercel dashboard and navigate to the project settings.
- Under "Usage," set up usage alerts for different metrics (e.g., serverless function invocations, bandwidth).
- Consider setting up a separate billing account with limits for production deployments.
- Regularly review your usage patterns and adjust limits as needed.
